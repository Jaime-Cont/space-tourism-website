## My process

- I started off by plotting down all the basic HTML Elements, setting up the main element, sections and divs that I deemed necessary to accomplish the challened.
- I proceeded to initialize my CSS Variables for easier color application and setting the main font size and weight, all according to the challenge's specifications.
- I would work on HTML and CSS in an alternating matter to match the output, until I was satisfied with the front end side of things.
- I then proceeded to work on JavaScript, initializing a var connected to all the elements I want the script to affect
- I would think of the logic behind getting the correct year, months and days
- Trial and Error till I got the output I was looking for.

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Responsive Media Queries
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript Object Notation (JSON)
